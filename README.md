A set of OBS sources of varying flexibility I use for my retro-style stream aesthetic to emulate windows and such.
Originally these were 95-style but I thought they looked better with the gradient so now it's closer to 98.
Also I just kinda mix in bits and bobs now.

You're free to use any part of these for whatever, they're pretty straightforward generally.
